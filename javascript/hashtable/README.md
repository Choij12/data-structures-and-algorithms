# Hashtables
- Create a HashTable with the following methods.
- Set method in which hashes the key and sets the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- Get method in which returns value associated with that key in the table.
- Contains method in which returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- Hash method in which returns an index in the collection for that key. Includes extensive test suite.

## Inputs / Outputs
