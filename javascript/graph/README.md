# Graph

## Problem Domain
- Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods: Add node, add Edge, get Nodes, get Neighbors, Size. 

## Inputs/Outputs
***Add Node***
- Input: Value 
- Output Added Node

***Add Edge*** 
- Input: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight(optional)
- Output: Nothing

***Get Nodes***
- Input: None
- Output: All nodes in the graph as a collection

***Get Neighbors***
- Input: Node
- Output: Collection of edges connected to the given node.

***Size***
- Input - None
- Output - Total number of nodes in the graph.

## Efficiency

**Add Node**

Time complexity: O(1)  

**Add Edge**

Time complexity: O(1)  

**Get Nodes**

Time complexity: O(n)  

**Get Neighbors**

Time complexity: O(n)

**Size**

Time complexity: O(n)
